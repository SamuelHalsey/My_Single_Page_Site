    <h2> Who Am I?</h2>

    <p style="color: green">
        I am a runner, I enjoy going on runs and competing in races.
        My hobbies include working out (before I injured myself) and playing videogames
    </p>

    <h2> What Business Would I Start Right Now?</h2>
    <p style="color: green">
        If I could start any business I would like to (similar to many other people in my IT Academy Class) make videogames for a living.
        However I am not very skilled I would like to improve, and I already have a friend learning to create assets that I could use in games
    </p>

    <h2> How Am I Going To Obtain The Things I Want Out Of Life?</h2>
    <p style="color: green">
        I will work towards my goals through learning, along with trial and error.
        I will strive for self improvement until I believe I have accomplished everything I want out of life
